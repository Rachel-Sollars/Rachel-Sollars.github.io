                I made this game in my first year of university as part of a multidisciplinary team. During the course of development I learned to work alongside other programmers, and communicate effectively with those outside of my specialism. Although we had setbacks when team members had to leave, we were able to adapt and rescope to deliver a game that we were happy with.

                In this game, which was developed in Unity, I was in charge of the player character movements, as well as the traps and their functionality. The player movement was implemented using a CharacterController rather than a Rigidbody, which gave us incredible control over the game feel, but led to reduced options for traps, as the physics was not properly affecting the character. I have learned from this the importance of looking into all methods for solving a problem so as to be informed as to their pros and cons.

                Over the course of development I saw a huge improvement in my C# skills, which led to me often wanting to go back and refactor old code. I regret not having calculated the wallrun path using the cross product of the surface normal and a static “up” vector, however I did not have as much vector maths knowledge at the time.
